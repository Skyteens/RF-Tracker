# RF-Tracker

This work introduces a simple motion tracker that transforms rotated bounding box detections into 2d Gaussians distributions and then uses distribution distances to associate which replicates the IoU association behaviour.

## Demo

1. prepare a folder of each video frame and its rotated bounding box detections
2. Run the demo.py with updated parameters
